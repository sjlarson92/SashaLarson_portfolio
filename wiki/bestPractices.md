# Best Practices

- Clean app more and refactor while working

- Improve name conventions

- Methods should be named after what they do.
   - Example: handleImageClick()
   - Should be able to determine what it does just by reading name

- Remove console.logs after use, to clean up code

- Make code pretty (IDE's have plugins to help with this)
   - Spacing and removing unused variables

- Stay DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - Reuse code when able

- Functions should not return multiple unrelated things (like a bool and a string)
