# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

## Inheritance
- The process of creating a new class (child) that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent), thereby promoting code reuse. 
- For example, a Car class inherits from a Vehicle class.

## Encapsulation
- It involves wrapping data (fields) and methods in a single unit (class) and restricting direct access using access modifiers. For example, private fields with public getters and setters.

## Abstraction
- This is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. 
- For example, a Vehicle class with an abstract stop method.

## Polymorphism
- It allows methods to perform differently based on the object they are invoked on. When two types share an inheritance chain, they can be used interchangeably with no errors.
