To start an application that uses a SqlServer database
you must first start up the database before you can run the application


1. Turn on Docker

2. Start Server
  docker start nameOfServer

  docker start sql_server_demo

3. run DotNet
  dotnet run  

To login to database
  I am using MsSQL for this project

  mssql -u username -p password





DBeaver is a GUI to show databases that I am using for this project
  Can be used just like commands in the terminal but with graphical user interface.
  Schema are "folders" used to organize tables in a database.

*application should begin running on localhost
