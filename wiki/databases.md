# Databases
- Stores data in tables (like rows and columns in a spreadsheet)

## ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
-  a tool that helps you interact with a database using code that is more familiar to programmers, like classes and objects, instead of using complex SQL queries directly.
- Why use ORMs?
  - Simplifies Database Work: Engineers do not have to manually write SQL every time.
  - Safety: Helps prevent errors like SQL injection (where malicious code could be inserted into a query).
  - Faster Development: Engineers can focus on logic, not the details of interacting with the database.
- Popular ORMs:
  - Python: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM 
  - Java: Hibernate, jOOQ
  - C#/.NET: Entity Framework
  - Ruby: ActiveRecord
  - Kotlin: Exposed, jOOQ
  - JavaScript/Node.js: Sequelize, TypeORM, Mongoose (for NoSQL), Objection.js
  - Go: GORM
