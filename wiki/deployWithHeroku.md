# Deploy App with Heroku

- Dyno = Server (essentially)

- If moving app from inside a repo make sure to connect to GitHub and then connect to Heroku

- `heroku git:remote -a rewards-program-app` connects project repo to Heroku

- check `git remote -v` to make sure you are pushing/fetchign from both Github and heroku

- use `git push heroku` to push to heroku
