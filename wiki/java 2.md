# Java

- check version `java -version`

## Hello World

## Running Java Code

- To run java code you first need to compile it. To compile code in the terminal use command: `javac fileName.java`
- If the file is succesfully compiled it will create a fileName.class file that can be run
- To run this file use the command: `java fileName`

## Comments

- When comments are short we use the single-line syntax: `//`
- When comments are long we use the multi-line syntax: `/*  */`
