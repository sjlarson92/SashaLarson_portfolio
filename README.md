## MONOREPOSITORY

In order to better display my projects I have set up my portfolio as a single repository. This allows me to properly showcase my large projects on center stage and organize my projects by technology allowing easy navigation.

## PROJECT SHOWCASE

This section shows some of my larger and favorite projects that I have worked on. I have included a summary of each project with details to the concepts, logic along with code snippets and screenshots.

Currently my most impressive complete projects were done in C#. I am also currently working on another large project in Python.

<!-- Project section -->
<h2><a href="https://github.com/sjlarson92/SashaLarson_portfolio/tree/master/c%23/CheeseMVCPersistent">Cheese MVC</a></h2>

<!-- Project BIO -->
Cheese MVC is a 'Single Page Application' website which allows the user to create a Menu along with different Cheese items with specific categories that can be set and added to a menu. This app is an exercise in creating a full-stack application with a front-end, back-end and database.

This app was made in roughly 2 months, by me and prewritten code provided by LaunchCode, a non-profit organization that provides free coding lessons to the community.

This application displays some of my skills with:

- C#
- MVC Web Framework
- MySQL
