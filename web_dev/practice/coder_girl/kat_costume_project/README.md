# Coder Girl Web Cohort
## Kat's Costume Shop

The purpose of completing this website is to create a mobile-first, responsive demonstration website to prove out and futher practice the HTML and CSS skills you have acquired.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your github account
2. Get the mobile website done 1st. Do **not** use any of the media selectors yet.
3. Support both mobile and larger than 660px. You can now use the 660px media selector.
4. Maximize your browser and support all formats. You can now use the 940px media selector.

## Structure of the repository

* The designs for the site are in `/design`
* All the images you will need are in `/assets/images`
* The text is already typed out in `index.html`
* There are already media selectors for handling larger website formats in the CSS file.
* The rest is on your own.
