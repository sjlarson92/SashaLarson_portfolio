@* YOU ARE HERE!! Your view should display an unordered list (that is, a <ul>) of category names. The list will look a bit plain for now, but we will make it more interesting later on. *@

@model List<CheeseMVC.Models.CheeseCategory>


    @foreach (var category in Model)
    {
        <ul>
          @category
        </ul>
    }
