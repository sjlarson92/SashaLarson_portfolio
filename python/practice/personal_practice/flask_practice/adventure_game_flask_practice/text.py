  Bang... bang .... bang

  What is that? Someone is making a lot of noise. Ugh, what is that noise? You were trying to sleep and you're so tired.
  Bang... Bang..
  Blinking your eyes open you slowly awaken.
  Bang... bang... bang...
  Seriously what is that? You see that you are in a white room, this doesn't look familiar. It's definitely not your bedroom, how did you get here?
  Bang... bang...
  Let's look around. There's some medical equipment lying around and another bed next to you. It's empty. You're definitely in a hospital, but why?
  bang...
  You slowly lift the blanket off yourself and get out of bed. Standing on wobbly legs you walk towards the end of the bed. There's a medical chart next to it hanging on the end. What does it say? (Get user input for name)

        Patient: User_input
        Blood Type: AB
        Age: unknown
        Diagnosis: Patient is victim of hit and run car accident. Has suffered trauma to the head and superficial injuries to arms and legs from collision. Medical induced coma is being implemented to assist in healing.

What? A car accident? Oh no. Looking down, you notice the healing bruises and cuts on your arms.

Bang...

You've been in a coma? What?! No way! That only happens in movies and post-apocalyptic tv shows?

Ok just stay calm. You can figure this out.

BANG! BAM!

You look towards the door, where that ridiculous banging sound keeps coming from. You move closer to it. The banging continues and you hear another sound coming from the other side. Sounds like someone's groaning?"""

She's sitting on the floor facing you, her eyes are clouded over and her arms hang limply at her sides. She's been dead for a while. Which makes you wonder how the flashlight battery isn't dead? (Author: Convenience!)
