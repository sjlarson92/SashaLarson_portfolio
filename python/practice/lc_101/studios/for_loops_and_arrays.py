# problem
# 1. how do i print each value in an array?
# 2. how do i print each instance on a new line?
#
#
# 4. How do I print each string with the different instance?
# 5. How do I solve for the value squared?
# 6. How do I print the string with the original value and the value squared?
#
# 7. How do i print each solution on a new line?
# 8. How do i print a line every other two values?
#
# step by step
#
# 1. go through the list and print each value
# 2.
# 4. use for loop to go through list and print each value with the string
# 5. print a blank every other two values
# 6. if index number % 2 = 1 print()
#
# solution
# index numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# index number 5
#
# if i %2 = 1 print ()
#
# i % 2 = 1
#
# solution: no
