# Problem
# Step by Step
# request raw_input from user of their name
# define function get_initials and allow it to pass an argument called fullname
# split the fullname in to a list to separate each name
# use a for loop to retrieve the first letter of each name
# make each letter capital
# print the initials with "." in between
#
# have input and print statement under main function separate from get_initials()
#
# Solution
