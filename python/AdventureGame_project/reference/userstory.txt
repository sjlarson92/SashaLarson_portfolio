Project 1: Adventure Game

1. Create a basic console game

  1.1 Plan the game

          -Intro:
            Greet player
            How many player are there?
            What are there names?
            Are you ready "insert player names"?

          -10 Chapters (which = 10 decisions by player)

          -Plus ending/epilogue/cliffhanger

        *CR(client requirement): game must allow up to 3 players at a time

        -plot: Player wakes up in an abandon hospital. While they were in a coma the world has become overrun by
        zombies, player must make choices in order to survive escaping the hospital. Will you make it?

    c. write out the story(outline)
        -story is written in plot.txt

  1.2 Start coding
    a. code each chapter
        -set up and make sure everything is working properly
        -run program by "python program name"
        -create a main function
          main function should be clean
        -code little & test little!!
          

    b. link each chapter to next step
